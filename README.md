# WindML

This repo provides a data analysis exemple of wind turbine performance prediction based on weather parameters. A simple Machine Learning model is built to predict wind turbine power output and torque. ENGIE open dataset is used as a practice sample.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda 3.6

### Getting started

```
# Navigate to your local folder
cd /your/local/folder

# Clone the WindML repository
git clone https://github.com/marcodigennaro/WindML  

# Enter the folder

# Create the Conda environment from the environment.yaml file
conda env create -f environment.yaml 

# Activate the Conda environment
conda activate windml

# Install this package
pip install . 

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter-lab  
```

Run any of the jupyter notebooks to visualize data and perform ML algorithms.
Data should be downloaded beforehand.
